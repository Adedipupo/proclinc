# How to Add Your Clinic Images

## Quick Guide

The homepage will automatically display your images when you add them to the `/public/images/` folder.

## Required Image Files

Add these 6 images to `/public/images/`:

1. **reception.jpg** - Your clinic's reception/waiting area
2. **consultation.jpg** - A consultation or examination room
3. **laboratory.jpg** - Your laboratory facilities
4. **team.jpg** - Photo of your medical team/staff
5. **ward.jpg** - Patient ward or recovery room
6. **exterior.jpg** - Outside view of your clinic building

## Image Guidelines

### File Format
- Use `.jpg` or `.jpeg` format
- File names must match exactly (lowercase)

### Image Size
- Recommended: 1200px x 800px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- Minimum: 800px x 600px
- Maximum file size: 500KB per image (compress if larger)

### Image Quality
- Use high-quality, well-lit photos
- Ensure images are sharp and clear
- Photos should look professional

## How the Gallery Works

1. **With Images**: When you add the images, they will display beautifully with overlay text
2. **Without Images**: Shows attractive placeholder cards with icons
3. **Automatic**: No code changes needed - just add the images!
